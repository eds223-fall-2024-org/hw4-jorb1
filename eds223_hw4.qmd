## Background

Marine aquaculture has the potential to play an important role in the global food supply as a more sustainable protein option than land-based meat production.1 Gentry et al. mapped the potential for marine aquaculture globally based on multiple constraints, including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, and bottom depth. They found that global seafood demand could be met using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area.
